# Space-War-Game
Lets see how long you can survive in my war space game!

In the openning screen, press enter when you are ready to let the game begin.

The game consist of the following elements:

Spaceship - which the user can control with the keyboard arrows keys. The goal of the spaceship is to fight the evil enemies that will show up throughout the game. It has a limited amount of health points, so it needs to be careful about getting hurt by rocks and enemies' shots. To defend himself, the user can shoot either the rocks or the enemies and destroy them. To shoot you need to hit space on the keyboard, and a yellow shot will be sent. Of course, the spaceship ammo is limited too, so use it cleverly. You can look in the top left corner to see the health bar and the ammo left on the spaceship.

Rock - the game generates rocks comming from above in a random directions. In one hand, the rocks can hurt the spaceship and make demage, but on the other hand, if the spaceship will destroy the rocks, some loot can get out of it (not always). And the rocks are even more interesting than that. The enemies' shots can destroy a rock too and when this is happening, the rock becomes evil and starts to move aiming at the spaceship!

Loot - the rocks that will be destroyed by the spaceship, with some probability, will remain a gift in the place of destruction. That gift can be either a health points, or an ammo supply of 50 shots. The get it, the spaceship needs the pass throw the gift position.

Enemies - will show up gradually throughout the game. The enemies look like spacecraft and can move only in the horizontal direction. They can shoot purple shots that can demage the spaceship and turn a rock into evil. To destroy an enemy spacecraft, 5 spaceship yellow shots need to hurt it.

The end of the game comes when the score (which can be seen in the top left corner) reaches 25,000.
Good Luck!
